  <p>My scrum team and I worked well to bounce ideas off of one another. We consistently previewed each otherâ€™s designs and provided each other with fresh perspectives about each site page. I, in particular, came to my team with many design related questions because I disliked my original layouts so much. My team members provided me with useful feedback to make my site look more sophisticated and professional than I had originally planned. 
I believe that I also provided some sound advice when working with our group because I enjoy experimenting with color and type. I think that I at least gave my group members some food for thought. 
I think I already had a solid grip on how and when to ask for help when working with a group because of previous experience, but I have also never faced the challenge of having no clue what I was doing. I tried to exhaust all other options before I asked for help, meaning I spent a ton of time on W3Schoolsm but I think that helped me ask more informed questions. It also helped me provide my group members with better answers.</p>

<p>During the workshops I mostly spent my time browsing codepen for designs that I liked to find inspiration. This gave me the idea to refine my color scheme and design choices. I set the goal to create something very simplistic but reflective of my aesthetic and personality, which I think I have achieved.</p> 

<p>I used <a=href"http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"> W3Schools</a> every time I tried to dive in to code! </p>
