  <p>I have focused on presentation thus far, and sort of deserted my content. This is because I am going for the bare bones of my website. Later, I will fill my site with blurbs and projects.</p>
  
  <p>So far, I have had some difficulty with CSS/HTML formatting. I have spent a lot of time on Codepen to find mark-up that I like and that I would like to use on my own webstite. However, this has made me stray somewhat from my original wireframe, which I expected. Going forward, I think I would like to take the time to find code I like, dissect it and make it my own, and then impliment it and add my own work to the code in the form of images and personal links. This will ensure that I have a solid website that can act as a piece of my portfolio if need be. I also believe that this will give me the opportunity to perfect each of my portfolio pieces as a separate project from creating the website. This way, I will have the creative space to create the most representative website I can. </p>
  
  <p> There have been some areas of my markup that I have found to be difficult. When I planned my site, I hoped to include a running slideshow on my landing page of various photos I have taken and photoshopped. This was going to act as a portfolio exhibition and eye-catching invitation to my page. However, I honestly have no idea how to go about making this code myself, and I cannot find a code on Codepen that acts exactly as I had pictured it. I have also had trouble coding for the nav. bar I have planned and changing it would greatly change the plans of my page as a whole. I am in the process of trying to format something that is true to my original design. </p>
